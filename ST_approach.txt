Originally I tried to use an r-trie to solve this symbol table. I did not completely understand how a r-trie worked so I thought it was the best option. After implementing it and seeing that it caused way to much wasted space and caused memory errors I realized that I needed to use a DLB. Rather than making another DLB class I used the same one and added the double time to each of the nodes. I then added all of the passwords and when the flag was 1 they added the time from the file as well.
